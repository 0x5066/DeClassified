Fusion AMPdeck 5.6

This is Blayde's legendary Winamp skin with easier-to-read colors in the Playlist and the Library.

Blayde created his Fusion skins when Winamp had not had an option to change skins yet.  He modified Winamp.exe by replacing the built-in skin with his own.

Blayde only skinned the main window, the only window of Winamp 1.  When Winamp 2 came out, his skins were updated by fans, including Robin Sylvestre, Thomas Wiggers and others.

In 2003, Wildrose-Wally took one of the updates, Fusion AMPdeck Special Edition by Thomas Wiggers and further updated it for Winamp 2.9 with modifications.  The result was announced at
