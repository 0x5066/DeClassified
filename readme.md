# DeClassified

This is the fourth incarnation of loading Classic Skin assets into the Modern Skin engine.

DeClassified provides a base (xml and scripts folder) that supports the Classic Skin layout, and emulates most of it's quirks to achieve the most accurate and authentic representation of Classic Skins possible, which is it's number one goal to achieve.

The idea of this project is to allow end-users/skin developers to mostly easily make ports of their own Classic Skins (or any Classic Skin) to the Modern Skin platform, so that they can enjoy the advanced features the Classic Skin layout simply cannot allow, with possible feature extensions through MAKI.

DeClassified wants to be as moddable as possible, with a clear structure in the XML and MAKI files where possible.

DeClassified can be compared to the barebones Classic Skin support Winamp3 provides, or the [WMC/WCL](https://github.com/garrjo/WMC_WCL_Template) framework, as both had attempted to emulate the Classic Skin feel, yet are nowhere near as good as DeClassified (and as extendable as DeClassified).

DeClassified can NOT be compared to [Winamp Classic Modern by Victhor](https://getwacup.com/community/index.php?topic=595.0) as they follow completely different ideas, and are thus incompatible with each other.

Future releases of DeClassified may implement features or additions Winamp 5.x and WACUP brought to the table.
